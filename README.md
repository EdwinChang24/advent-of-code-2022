These are my solutions for Advent of Code[^aoc], written in [Kotlin][kotlin].
I'm using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] created by JetBrains.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day
    for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
